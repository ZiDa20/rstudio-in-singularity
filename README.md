"# rstudio-in-singularity" 

Run RStudio on a High Performance Computing Cluster

1) Create the singularity environment -> 
	Download the rocker image: singularity pull docker://rocker/rstudio:4.2 (there is a manual available: https://rocker-project.org/use/singularity.html)

2) run the rstudio script (rstudio.sh) with your job manager, here slurm is used.
sbatch rstudio.sh
cat rstudio-server.job.{JOBID}


3) with ssh-fowarding, forward the rstudio port to your localhost port which should have been displayed after the cat command. open a webbrowser and open http://localhost:8787, the login credentials should have been displayed after the cat command too. 


4) To install libaries (on the hpc), use the correct R-environment (here 4.2) and install the packages into a specific user library via packages.install()

5) Within the RStudio Console, add the path to your new library: 
myPaths <- .libPaths()
myPaths <- c(myPaths, "/home/user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2”)
.libPaths(myPaths)
The path can be changed within the install packages tab in RStudio

Good Luck ;)
